TheMovieDB-MVP

Two-screen android application showing a listing of TMDB's most popular TV shows (themoviedb.org is a free and open database with millions of data related to the world of cinema). This application is written in Model-view-presenter (MVP) Architectural Pattern.

To query data from the TMDB API it is necessary to create an account in the portal: https://www.themoviedb.org/account/signup and create an application in the API as indicated in https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started, once we get an API Key we copy it and paste it into the variable TMDB_API_KEY of the gradle.properties file of the android project.
